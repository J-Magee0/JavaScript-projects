## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Generates random passwords
- 🔒 Allows customization (length + character sets)
- 📋 One-click copy to clipboard
- 📱 Fully responsive UI
- 🧠 Clean and beginner-friendly code

## 💡 Usage

Once the app loads:

Choose the desired password length

Select which character types to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

Click Generate

Click Copy to save it to your clipboard

This tool makes creating secure random passwords quick and fun.

## 🧠 How It Works

The app takes user preferences (like length and character types) and uses JavaScript to build a random password from those options. This is done by:

Assembling a character pool

Picking random characters until the desired length is reached

Updating the UI with the generated password

This basic logic is ideal for learning more about DOM manipulation and randomness in JS
